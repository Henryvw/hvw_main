**Note added Jan 24 2019: In order to replace an image asset, try deleting the old version of the asset in the public folder. (After you do rails assets:precompile - and update the manifest AND the "compiled" CSS and JS files that point to all the new image URLs). This seems to trigger the compilation of the asset on the heroku server. This worked today. I can't confirm that it will always be necessary, or will always be the solution.**
